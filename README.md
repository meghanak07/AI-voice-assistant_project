This assistant will do the following things: 1.Greeting you as per Real time. 2.play misc in online and offline 3.searches in the google 4.open any application in internet 5.open applications like ms excel,ms word etc 6.Boost the energy, if the user in low mood Everyone is recognizable how Al(Artificial Insight) is overseeing the world with its power and impact in this contemporary time. Generally we are natural about machine to machine cooperation yet presently it is conceivable that a human and a machine would be able made to interface with one another investigating every others choices. This framework is intended to be utilized effectively on desktops.Voice look have ruled over text search. Web look led through cell phones have just barely surpassed those completed utilizing a PC and the investigators are previously foreseeing that half of searches will be through voice by 2022. The comprehension furthermore, executing orders are arrived at another level like the remote helper of the iron man named Jarvis. This is albeit fictitious yet this is the very thing that can accomplished use menial helpers. You should simply provide an order to the collaborator and the rest will be compelling An AI voice assistant is a software application that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks accordingly. It's a personal assistant that can assist with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries, and more. The project involves developing an intelligent convers ational interface that can understand voice commands, process them, and respond accordingly. The AI voice assistant can be integrated into various devices like smartphones, smart home devices, and more. [4] The AI voice assistant project involves several steps, including: Step 1: Define the AI voice assistant's capabilities Step 2: Choose the platform and tools Step 3: Design the conversational interface Step 4: Develop the AI voice assistant Step 5: Test and refine the AI voice assistant The AI voice assistant can be used in various industries like healthcare, finance, education, and more. It can assist with tasks like scheduling appointments, sending messages, making calls, and more. The AI voice assistant can also be used to control smart home devices, play music, and more.

The benefits of an AI voice assistant include: Convenience: Users can perform tasks hands-free, making it easier to multitask and increase productivity. Accessibility: AI voice assistants can assist people with disabilities, elderly, and those with limited mobility. Personalization: AI voice assistants can learn a user's preferences and tailor their responses accordingly. Efficiency: AI voice assistants can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more important activities.

Some popular examples of AI voice assistants include: Amazon Alexa Google Assistant Apple Siri Microsoft Cortana

To develop an AI voice assistant, various technologies and tools are used, including: Natural Language Processing (NLP): to understand and process voice commands Machine Learning (ML): to train the AI model to recognize patterns and make predictions Speech Recognition: to transcribe voice commands into text Text-to-Speech (TTS): to generate audio responses

The project requires a multidisciplinary team with expertise in: Software development: to develop the AI voice assistant's core functionality UX/UI design: to design the conversational interface and user experience NLP/ML engineering: to develop and train the AI model Quality assurance: to test and refine the AI voice assistant
